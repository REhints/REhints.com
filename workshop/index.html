<h1>Advanced Threats Reverse Engineering</h1>

<p>The workshop is devoted to analysis of malware created using object oriented programming languages. In recent time we see a large spike of complex threats with elaborate object-oriented architecture among which the most notorious examples are: Stuxnet, Flamer, Duqu. The approaches to analysis of such malware are rather distinct compared to the malware developed using procedural programming languages. The authors will consider the examples written in C++ and compiled with MS Visual C++.</p>

<p>In the workshop the authors will share with participants experience of reverse engineering object-oriented code which theyâ€™ve accumulated over the recent years while performing analysis of complex threats.</p>

<h3>Topics:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Introduction into object-oriented code reverse engineering: calling conventions, compiler transformations, system structures (vftables, RTTI) and etc.</li>
    <li>using static code analysis tools for reconstructing complex data types</li>
    <li>automating C++ code reverse engineering using IDA Python and Hex-Rays Decompiler SDK</li>
    <li>methodology of object type reconstruction using Hex-Rays Decompiler extensions (HexRaysCodeXplorer)</li>
    <li>analysis of malware with object-oriented architecture (C++) and position independent code: STuxnet, Flame, Gapz</li>
</ul>
<p>Participant will receive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>understanding of object-oriented and position independent code with respect to reverse engineering</li>
    <li>practical experience of using IDA Pro and Hex-Rays Decompiler for reconstructing complex data types</li>
    <li>basics of developing plugins for Hex-Rays Decompiler</li>
    <li>practical experience of complex threat analysis: Stuxnet, Flamer, Gapz</li>
</ul>
