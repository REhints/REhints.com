Advanced Threats Reverse Engineering
====================================
The workshop is devoted to analysis of malware created using object oriented programming languages. In recent time we see a large spike of complex threats with elaborate object-oriented architecture among which the most notorious examples are: Stuxnet, Flamer, Duqu. The approaches to analysis of such malware are rather distinct compared to the malware developed using procedural programming languages. The authors will consider the examples written in C++ and compiled with MS Visual C++.

In the workshop the authors will share with participants experience of reverse engineering object-oriented code which theyâ€™ve accumulated over the recent years while performing analysis of complex threats.

###Topics:
Introduction into object-oriented code reverse engineering: calling conventions, compiler transformations, system structures (vftables, RTTI) and etc.
using static code analysis tools for reconstructing complex data types
automating C++ code reverse engineering using IDA Python and Hex-Rays Decompiler SDK
methodology of object type reconstruction using Hex-Rays Decompiler extensions (HexRaysCodeXplorer)
analysis of malware with object-oriented architecture (C++) and position independent code: STuxnet, Flame, Gapz
Participant will receive:
understanding of object-oriented and position independent code with respect to reverse engineering
practical experience of using IDA Pro and Hex-Rays Decompiler for reconstructing complex data types
basics of developing plugins for Hex-Rays Decompiler
practical experience of complex threat analysis: Stuxnet, Flamer, Gapz

a laptop with preinstalled IDA Pro and Hex-Rays Decompiler
