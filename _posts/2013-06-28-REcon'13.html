<a href="http://recon.cx/2013/index.html">REcon conference</a> was great! For us it's most interesting event for presenting research about hardcore reverse engineering stuff. In this year most discussed talk titles was around hardware reverse engineering. And we are one of the few people reported about software RE and presented our talk **Reconstructing Gapz: Position-Independent Code Analysis Problem**.
