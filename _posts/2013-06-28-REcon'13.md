[REcon conference](http://recon.cx/2013/index.html) has been a great event this year! For us, it's one of the most interesting conferences to present research about hardcore reverse engineering stuff. In this year most of the talks at REcon were focused on hardware reverse engineering. So we are those of a few people who were speaking about software RE and presented our talk **Reconstructing Gapz: Position-Independent Code Analysis Problem**.
